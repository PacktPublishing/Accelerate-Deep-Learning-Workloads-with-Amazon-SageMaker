This is the code repository for [Accelerate Deep Learning Workloads with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.packtpub.com/product/accelerate-deep-learning-workloads-with-amazon-sagemaker/9781801816441?_ga=2.215362839.1206990960.1667214783-1347501151.1654864057), published by Packt.

**Train, deploy and scale deep learning models effectively using Amazon SageMaker**

## What is this book about?
Over the past 10 years, Deep Learning grew from a narrow academic research field to a wide-scale adoption across multiple industries. Deep Learning models demonstrate superior results on benchmark tasks as well as on a wide range of practical tasks, underpinning emerging fields such as Autonomous Driving, Robotics, and Natural Language Understanding.

You will learn about practical aspects of designing, building, and optimizing Deep Learning workloads on Amazon SageMaker. The book also provides end-to-end implementation examples for popular Deep Learning tasks, such as Computer Vision and NLU/NLP. You will begin by exploring key Amazon SageMaker capabilities in the context of Deep Learning. Then you will explore in detail the theoretical and practical aspects of training and hosting your DL models on Amazon SageMaker. You will learn how to train and serve DL models using popular open source frameworks, and understand the hardware and software options you have to optimize your workload. You will then implement several state-of-the-art models for Computer Vision and NLP tasks.

By the end of this book, readers will be fluent in the software and hardware aspects of running Deep Learning workloads using Amazon SageMaker.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Cover key capabilities of Amazon SageMaker relevant for deep learning workloads
* Design and implement efficient training of DL models
* Deploy, monitor, and optimize the serving of DL models
* Gain experience in building, training, and serving DL models
* Build state-of-the-art NLP and Vision models on SageMaker

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
estimator.fit({
  "train":"s3://unique/path/train_files/",
  "test":"s3://unique/path/test_files"
})
```
