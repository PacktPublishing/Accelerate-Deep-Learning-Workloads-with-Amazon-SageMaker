After that we will tune model performance using NeuronCores `torch.neuron.DataParallel` and dynamic batching capabilities. \n",

    "1. **Selecting instance.** To run this exmple, you need to run this notebook on `inf1.6xlarge` instance. At the time of writing SageMaker Notebook Instances and SageMaker Studio Notebooks don't support Inferentia-based instances. Hence, you will need to use AWS EC2 instance instead. It's recommended to use latest Deep Learning AMI GPU PyTorch image for it which comes with Jupyter environment pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting up Neuron SDK.** You need to follow setup NeuronSDK guide to install it and other dependencies. Refer to latest documentation here: https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/frameworks/torch/torch-neuron/setup/pytorch-install.html\n",
