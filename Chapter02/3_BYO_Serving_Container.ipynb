    "## BYO Serving Container on SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop SageMaker-compatible container for inference. We will use latest TensorFlow container as a base image and use AWS Multi-Model Server (\"MMS\") as a model server. Please note that MMS is one of several ML model serving options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Overview\n",
    "We will use pre-trained [VGG16 model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) to classify content of the images into 1000 categories. The model is trained on ImageNet dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Keras Deep Learning library which is now a part of TensorFlow code base. Hence, we choose choose latest TensorFlow container as a base. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing Serving Container\n",
    "When deploying serving container to endpoint SageMaker runs `docker run <YOUR BYO IMAGE> serve` command. To comply with this requirement it's reccommended to use exec format of ENTRYPOINT instruction in your Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review our BYO Dockerfile:\n",
    "- we use latest tensorflow-devel container as base.\n",
    "- we install general and SageMaker specific dependencies.\n",
    "- we copy our model serving scripts to container.\n",
    "- we specify ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions to comply with SageMaker requirements."

    "\n",
    "In this example we don't intend to cover MMS and development of inference scripts in details. However, it's worth highlighting some key script aspects:\n",
    "- `dockerd_entrypoint.py` is an excuitable which starts MMS server when `serve` argument is passed to it.\n",
    "- `model_handler.py` implements model loading and model serving logics. Note, that method `handle()` checks if model is already loaded into memory. If it's not, it will load model into memory once and then proceed to handling serving request which includes:\n",
