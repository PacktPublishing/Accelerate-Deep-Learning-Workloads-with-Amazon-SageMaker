    "In this notebook, we will learn how to develop training and inference scripts using HuggingFace framework. We will leverage SageMaker pre-build containers for HuggingFace (with PyTorch backend).\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to solve a typical NLP task - text classification. We will use `20 Newsgroups` dataset which assembles ~ 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different newsgroups (categories).\n",

    "By the end of this notebook you will learn how to:\n",
    "- prepare text corpus for training and inference using Amazon SageMaker;\n",
    "- develop training script to run in pre-build HugginFace container;\n",
    "- configure and schedule training job;\n",
    "- develop inference code;\n",

    "Our study task is to train model which can categorize newsgroup article based on its content into one of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are number of model architecture which can address this task. Existing State-of-the-art (SOTA) models are usually based on Transformer architecture. Autoregressive models like BERT and its various derivatives are suitable for this task. We will use concept known as `Transfer learning` where pre-trained model on one task is used for a new task with minimal modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a baseline model we will use model architecture known as `DistilBERT` which provides high accuracy on wide variety of tasks and is considerably smaller than other models (for instance, original BERT model).

You can use `model_fn()` to initiatilize other components of your inference pipeline, such as tokenizer in our case. Note, that HuggingFace Transformers has a convenient Pipeline API which allows to combine data pre-processing (in our case, text tokenization) and actual inference in a single object. Hence, instead of loaded model, we return inference pipeline (line #45).\n",

Since we are communicating with end-client via HTTP, we also need to do payload deserialization and response serialization.
